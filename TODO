Neighboring matrix contains infinity?

Dubins in RRT - rework Lazy TSP to sample multiple source/destination angles?
Dubins in RRT - rework (somehow) Multi-T-RRT*?

SFF - more sampling angles for each node? => solve dubins touring problem, or DTSP?
 - use uniform or informed sampling, use DIP solution?
 
 Asymptotic optimality? does not converge to optimal solution in infinity

3D Dubins - write to Robert ?
